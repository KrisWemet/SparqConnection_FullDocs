# Sparq Connection Security Documentation

## Client-Side Encryption

Sparq Connection implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive user data including reflections, quiz answers, and private messages. This document outlines the security measures and encryption implementation.

### Encryption Implementation

We use the `crypto-js` library to implement AES-256-CBC encryption with the following security features:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key in CBC mode)
- **Key Generation**: Secure random key generation for user key pairs
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Random IV for each encryption operation
- **Data Padding**: PKCS7 padding scheme

### Data Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - A unique key pair (public/private) is generated for each user
   - Private key is never transmitted to the server
   - Public key is stored in Firestore for other users to access

2. **Journey Reflections**:
   - Reflections are encrypted with user's private key before transmission
   - Each reflection uses a unique IV
   - Encrypted data and IV are stored separately
   - Only the user can decrypt their reflections

3. **Quiz Answers**:
   - Quiz answers are encrypted individually
   - Each answer includes its own IV
   - Score calculation is done server-side on encrypted data
   - Raw answers are never stored unencrypted

4. **Private Messages**:
   - Messages are encrypted with a shared secret
   - Shared secret is derived from sender's private key and recipient's public key
   - Each message uses a unique IV
   - Messages can only be decrypted by intended recipient

### Security Measures

1. **Key Management**:
   - Private keys never leave the client
   - Keys are generated using cryptographically secure random number generation
   - Public keys are stored securely in Firestore
   - Key rotation is supported through profile updates

2. **Data Protection**:
   - All sensitive data is encrypted before transmission
   - Each encryption operation uses a unique IV
   - Encrypted data and IVs are stored separately
   - No sensitive data is stored in plaintext

3. **Transport Security**:
   - All API communications use HTTPS
   - WebSocket connections are secured with TLS
   - API endpoints require authentication
   - Rate limiting is implemented on sensitive endpoints

4. **Client-Side Security**:
   - Private keys are stored securely in browser
   - Memory is cleared after encryption/decryption
   - No sensitive data is logged or cached
   - Service workers handle offline encryption

### Code Example

```typescript
// Encrypting data
const encryptedData = encrypt(sensitiveData, userPrivateKey);
// Returns: { data: "encrypted...", iv: "..." }

// Decrypting data
const decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, userPrivateKey);
```

### Best Practices

1. **Key Storage**:
   - Store private keys securely
   - Never transmit private keys
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Implement key backup solutions

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before transmission
   - Use unique IVs for each encryption
   - Verify data integrity after decryption
   - Clear sensitive data from memory

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement secure error handling
   - Don't expose encryption details in errors
   - Log encryption failures securely
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

4. **Compliance**:
   - Follow data protection regulations
   - Implement privacy by design
   - Regular security audits
   - Document all security measures
